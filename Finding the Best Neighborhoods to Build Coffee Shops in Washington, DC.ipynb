    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis can help determine the best location to build a coffee shop in Washington, DC. Great locations for coffee shops are locations where there is a shortage of coffee shops compared to the number of coffee drinkers in the area, and where the location can be accessible to the most people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Foursquare API is a great data source for information needed to find locations that best match the above criteria. The Foursquare API can find coffee shop locations in DC and provide the number of check-ins at the coffee shop. This data will help us learn which areas have a high ratio of coffee shop customers to the number of cofee shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can combine the Foursquare data with neighborhood data from Washington, DC. DC's data includes clusters of neighborhoods, which can serve a reference points. We can also incorporate Metro stop data from DC. The Metro is DC's public railway system, and it serves a significant number of customers. We can use this data to determine the degree to which the number of metro stops in a given area correlates with the number of coffee shops in the same area. This will be a helpful data point relevant to our analysis because Metro stops increase the accessibililty of a coffee shop."

    "## Data and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish the above analysis, we'll take the following methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Acquire and clean DC neighborhood geo data\n",
    "2. Acquire and clean DC metro stops geo data\n",
    "3. Generate the number of metro stops per area unit of each neighborhood\n",
    "4. Query the Foursquare API for coffee shops in each neighborhood\n",
    "5. Locate the neighborhoods that were in the vicinity of the coffee shops\n",
    "6. Determine which neighborhoods had the highest number of cofee shops per area unit\n",
    "7. Assess the correlation between metro stops and coffee shops in each neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to some constraints using a free Foursquare API developer account, we'll make some modifications to our approach and methodology along the way, while noting how our analysis could be improved with better access to the Foursquare API data. The following still demonstrates, however, the validity and usefulness of our methodology and approach and how it can be tailored to recommend the best locations for building a coffee shop in DC."

    "There is a slight inverse correlation between the two variables, meaning there are slightly less coffee shops in areas that have greater Metro access. There is an opportunity here: locations closer to Metro stops increase the number of potential customers both by virtue of their proximity to a stop and because a coffee shop closer to a Metro stop would have an advantage over other coffee shops, which are typically farther away from Metro stops."

Because of the limitations of the free developer account, I cannot offer a recommendation here. Despite lacking full access to the developer API, the method and approach are sound and can offer insights into determining the proper location. To recap the method and approach I proposed and demonstrated here, I:\n",
